# Module 3 Project

## Introduction

In this project, I analyze the Northwind database with the goal of making recommendations to a business, so that they can boost their profits and improve their efficiency.  If you'd like to read more about the requirements and goals for this project, check out the project assignment (projectIntro.MD).

## Files in the Repository

### Project 3 Jupyter Notebook

The jupyter notebook (FinalMod3Project.ipynb) includes all of my code and explanations about what/how I'm doing things.  It also includes a summary of my conclusions and ideas for future work.  Honestly, if you've only got the time/inclination to read one thing in this repository, the jupyter notebook is the file to check out.

### The Readme

That's this document. It's just a table of contents for the project, basically.

### The Non-technical Presentation

The presentation (Mod3Project.pdf) is aimed at a business audience. In this particular instance, I was pretending that Andrew and Steven (the managers in the Northwind database) were my audience.  Great salesmen and managers but not particularly strong when it comes to data science.  They're mainly just interested in knowing how to make their business better.
